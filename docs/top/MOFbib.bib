	abstract = {This paper reviews the literature concerning forest and woodland structure at the scale of an individual stand. Stand structure is defined in terms of structural attributes and stand structural complexity. Stand structural complexity is considered to be a measure of the number of different attributes present and the relative abundance of each of these attributes. The review indicates there is no definitive suite of structural attributes; different authors emphasise subsets of different attributes, and relatively few studies provide quantitative evidence linking attributes to the provision of faunal habitat or other measures of biodiversity, although a number of studies identify attributes that distinguish between successional stages. A summary of key structural attributes identified in the literature is presented under the following stand elements: foliage arrangement, canopy cover, tree diameter, tree height, tree spacing, tree species, stand biomass, understorey vegetation, and deadwood. Indices of structural complexity are also reviewed. Three types of index framework are identified: indices based on the cumulative score of attributes; indices based on the average score of groups of attributes; and indices based on the interaction of attributes. The review identifies a variety of different indices under each of these frameworks with no single index preferred over the others. The most prominent of these indices are discussed in detail and the following guidelines suggested for the development of an index of structural complexity: (1) Start with a comprehensive set of structural attributes, in which there is a demonstrated association between attributes and the elements of biodiversity that are of interest. (2) Use a simple mathematical system to construct the index; this facilitates the use of multiple attributes and interpretation of the index in terms of real stand conditions. (3) Score attributes relative to the range of values occurring in stands of a comparable vegetation community. (4) Try different weightings of attributes in the index, adopting those weightings which most clearly distinguish between stands.},

	abstract = {The relevance of stand structural heterogeneity for biodiversity conservation is increasingly recognized and efficient tools for its measurement are demanded. Here, we quantified forest structure by calculating the effective number of layers (ENL) for different Hill Numbers (0D, 1D, 2D) as a measure of vertical structure of a subplot. We than use sampling techniques to cover the horizontal structural variability within study plots. ENL describes the vertical structure based on the occupation of 1m wide vertical layers by tree components relative to the total space occupation of a stand. Space occupation was quantified by a voxel-model obtained from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) on 150 forest plots in Germany. We used a single scan approach, which requires less field work and post-processing compared to multiple-scans. Single-scan derived mean ENL and its coefficient of variation successfully differentiated forest structures over a wide range of even-aged, uneven-aged and unmanaged broadleaved and coniferous stands. ENL was correlated to the stand summary measures basal area, quadratic mean diameter and stem density as well as stand age. ENL can be used to describe structural heterogeneity and proved to be efficiently assessable by TLS.},

	abstract = {Individual tree architecture and the composition of tree species play a vital role for many ecosystem functions and services provided by a forest, such as timber value, habitat diversity, and ecosystem resilience. However, knowledge is limited when it comes to understanding how tree architecture changes in response to competition. Using 3D-laser scanning data from the German Biodiversity Exploratories, we investigated the detailed three-dimensional architecture of 24 beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees that grew under different levels of competition pressure. We created detailed quantitative structure models (QSMs) for all study trees to describe their branching architecture. Furthermore, structural complexity and architectural self-similarity were measured using the box-dimension approach from fractal analysis. Relating these measures to the strength of competition, the trees are exposed to reveal strong responses for a wide range of tree architectural measures indicating that competition strongly changes the branching architecture of trees. The strongest response to competition (rho = −0.78) was observed for a new measure introduced here, the intercept of the regression used to determine the box-dimension. This measure was discovered as an integrating descriptor of the size of the complexity-bearing part of the tree, namely the crown, and proven to be even more sensitive to competition than the box-dimension itself. Future studies may use fractal analysis to investigate and quantify the response of tree individuals to competition.},
