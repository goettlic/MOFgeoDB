# General Situation
Collecting data happens in various ways:

1. systematic in context of research 
2. more or less chaotic in the context of teaching
3. private to fill the gaps of 2. or any other reason
4. automatic in a fixed time interval
5. individual once in a lifetime or in a fixed interval

The second pretends not collecting faulty data but during courses often time is limited to collect everything is needed or the intention of the course is just focused on a special question or learning the actual method.
